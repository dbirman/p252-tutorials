(Based on comments from Ewart)

Module 1:

 - Simple Linear Regression (using an example)
 - Basic ggplot()

Module 2:
 - Lists
 - Manipulating Data Frames
 - Factors
 - Reading Data

 - t.test()
 - lm()

Module 3:
 - Advanced R Syntax (dplyr)
 - Function writing + Syntax
 - Multiple Regression
 - Additive/Interactions
 - Advanced ggplot() (with an example)

Goals:

(1) Elimnate the acute anxiety students feel in the first two weeks!

(2) TA comfort w/ material: make sure that if somebody doesn't know a function or library there is an alternative way to present it (e.g. ggplot)

(3) All students exposed to multiple data sets: introduce them to asking interesting questions and being curious.

(4) Mixture of R syntax and Stats concepts: focus less on perfection and more on general exposure.
